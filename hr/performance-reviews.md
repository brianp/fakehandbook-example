# Performance Review Process

## Philosophy

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Performance reviews at Nexus are designed to support growth, not just evaluate past work.

## Review Cycle

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem:

| Milestone | Timing | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Q1 Reviews | February | Goal setting, development planning |
| Mid-Year Check-in | July | Progress review, course correction |
| Q4 Reviews | November | Full evaluation, compensation review |

## Competency Framework

Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit. Employees are evaluated across four dimensions:

### Technical Excellence
Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit. Depth of expertise, code quality, architectural thinking, and technical decision-making.

### Impact & Execution
Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse. Delivering results, meeting commitments, and driving projects to completion.

### Collaboration
At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis. Working effectively with others, communication, and cross-functional partnership.

### Leadership
Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio. Mentorship, influence, strategic thinking (applies at all levels, not just managers).

## Rating Scale

Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio:

- **Exceptional (5):** Consistently exceeds expectations, role model
- **Strong (4):** Regularly exceeds expectations
- **Meeting (3):** Consistently meets expectations
- **Developing (2):** Partially meeting expectations, needs improvement
- **Below (1):** Not meeting expectations, requires immediate action

## 360 Feedback

Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis. Feedback is collected from:

- Direct manager
- 3-5 peers (self-selected + manager-selected)
- Direct reports (for managers)

## Calibration

Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus. Ratings are calibrated across teams to ensure consistency and fairness. Your manager will represent your work in calibration sessions.

## Compensation

Compensation adjustments are made annually following Q4 reviews. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, factors include:
- Performance rating
- Market data
- Internal equity
- Company performance
