# Paid Time Off Policy

## Overview

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. At Nexus Technologies, we believe in sustainable work and encourage everyone to take time to rest and recharge.

## Flexible PTO

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium. We operate on a flexible PTO model, which means:

- No fixed number of vacation days
- Take what you need, when you need it
- Minimum expectation: 15 days per year (excluding holidays)

### Guidelines

Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur:

1. **Advance Notice:** Request time off at least 2 weeks in advance for trips longer than 3 days
2. **Coverage:** Ensure your responsibilities are covered during your absence
3. **Communication:** Update your calendar and set Slack status
4. **Documentation:** Log time off in BambooHR for record-keeping
